This project applies various unsupervised learning techniques to cluster fitness data. Clustering Algorithms: Application of K-means, GaussianMixture, SpectralClustering, Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering. Evaluation: Using Elbow determine the optimal number of clusters and evaluate clustering performance with Silhouette scores, Calinski-Harabasz Index, and Davies-Bouldin Index.
